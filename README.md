# NLP_Sequential-NLP

PART A
•	DOMAIN: Digital content and entertainment industry

•	CONTEXT: The objective of this project is to build a text classification model that analyses the customer's sentiments
based on their reviews in the IMDB database. The model uses a complex deep learning model to build an embedding layer followed by a classification algorithm to analyse the sentiment of the customers.

•	PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To Build a sequential NLP classifier which can use input text parameters to determine the customer sentiments

PART B
•	DOMAIN: Social media analytics

•	CONTEXT: Past studies in Sarcasm Detection mostly make use of Twitter datasets collected using hashtag based supervision but such datasets
are noisy in terms of labels and language. Furthermore, many tweets are replies to other tweets and detecting sarcasm in these requires the availability of contextual tweets.
In this hands-on project, the goal is to build a model to detect whether a sentence is sarcastic or not, using Bidirectional LSTMs.

•	PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Build a sequential NLP classifier which can use input text parameters to determine the customer sentiments
